Hi Peter,

In order to finalize the results for the shock tube paper, I need to plot data as far out after the shock that we have data for.

Also, we want to see if we can plot Trioxane and/or Iodoethane before the shocks. What this means is that we need to look at all the IGs.

could you please phase correct all IGs for the following data runs and the location of the shocks?

    June 30th, Batt 4&5				: script-1.py
    June 30th, Batt 8&29			: script-2.py
    June 30th, Batt.   28 & 29		: script-3.py
    April 24th, surf 27&28 			: script-4.py

I know itâ€™s a lot of data to process, but if you could get me these by Wednesday would be great. We need to wrap this up and start writing soon ðŸ˜Š

Thanks,

Nazanin
